                            <li>Round the egdes of the boxes or make them totally circled</li>

                    <li><h2>Time spent on the project</h2></li>
                    <p>I nearly 2-3 hours per day for the days 25/3-3/4. I also spent some time before searching on the web for ideas on CSS styles and watching youtube videos. </p>
                    <li><h2>Difficulties</h2></li>
                    <p>I am a total beginner in using html and CSS to create a webpage, so my first difficult part was to understand how the commands work and what each command can help you do. After that, my goal was a nice looking webpage that doesn't look 'sketchy'. Because of that I try to see what I can do as a beginner to make it prettier. Some of the most difficult parts was to put the headings and the pictures(from the html file) on the right positions and the absolute/relative position. Moreover, how to place the list of links on the header was a bit tricky. Last, but not least, I made a lot of tries and search a lot to achieve the overlay class for the pictures of the last section. All in all, I really enjoy the process and I am looking forward for the next task!</p>
